<!--
Echo a message at the specified severity level, prefixed with the current date and time.
Target needs to be antcall'ed so that we can update the time on each call (since Ant properties are immutable).
The target is placed in its own build file (rather than build-common), since antcall re-parses the build file each time, so we want it small.
The simplest way to antcall this is use the echo-time macro in build-common.xml.
